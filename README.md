# ReduceImageSize
Download from GDrive , reduce Image Size, Upload to new Folder in GDrive

This project uses GDrive APIs to download specific folder from GDrive and reduces the Image file sizes for all files and then uploads in another GDrive folder.

I am currently working on mode 2 to download from photos.google.com and upload into GDrive or even photos.google.com
